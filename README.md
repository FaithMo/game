In `script.js`, line 1 selects or fetches the `index.html` using ```document.querySelectorAll(".tiles")```.
which works when you want to open the `index.html` on the browser. 

However, when testing using *jsdom* line 2 of `script.js` is used instead of one. Depending on what you need to do, consider the functions of these lines of code and uncomment whichever respectfully.
